# AR Interior Design Application

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to assist users in visualizing and designing interior spaces. The application allows users to place, move, and interact with virtual furniture, providing a realistic preview of how their room will look.

## Features

- **Marker-Based AR:** Utilizes marker recognition to identify specific images or symbols in the real world, allowing for precise placement of virtual objects.

- **Optimization:** Implements object pooling technique to optimize CPU performance, ensuring a smoother and more efficient AR experience. Also, batching is done for drawcalls to reduce the load on GPU.

- **Placement-Recommendation System:** Includes a basic text based recommendation system to assist users in placing virtual furniture, enhancing the overall user experience.
